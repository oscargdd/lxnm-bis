# Introduction


Network Service Yang models {{?RFC8199}}{{?RFC8309}} such as L3NM {{?RFC9182}} and L2NM {{?RFC9291}} have been implemented in recent years to facilate the deployment of Operator services. This document reports the findings from the implementations, deriving the functionalities required to update the Network Service Yang models. 

{{?RFC8969}} documents the automation framework. {{?RFC9315}} documents Intent-based networking from IRTF perspective, with specific problems which are addressable today after the first deployments have been done.

# Network Service Yang Model Work in IETF

   A number of IETF working groups have developed YANG modules related
   to facilitate the deployement of services.  These models focus on 
   how the network operator intents to configures the network through
   protocols and devices to deliver a service. The intended configuration
   at the device level is derived from those network Yang models. 
   The customer service Yang models abstract the service for upper layers. The
   intended network service configuration is derived from the the service model.
   
   A set of these models is listed here:

   * {{RFC9182}} As a complement to the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service Model (L3SM), 
   which is used for communication between customers and service providers, 
   L3NM is a Network Model (L3NM) that can be used for the provisioning of 
   BGP based Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) services within a service provider network.

   * {{?RFC9291}} documents a data model that describes the deployment of
   various types of L2VPN, including VPWS and BGP based L2VPN, such as EVPNs.
  
# Observations and new requirements

## Enhancements with new features 
Implementations of LxNM models in controllers required new functionalities which were not covered in the RFCxxx yang models to deploy all the functionality required in the Operator services. This section compiles the functions that were reported by those implementations. 

### L3NM enhancements
* BFD parametrization of static routes (Github issue #1):
  * The L3NM Yang data model allows to manage static routes in a VPN. That is, for a particular VPN service, new Pv4 and IPv6 static routes can be added, modified or deleted. The data model allows to specify wether BFD is desired in the static route. Whenever a controller derives the device configuration of the static route it will need to decide a particular BFD configuration, typically from a pre-defined template. Operators required, for different services, to customize the main BFD parameters to allow, for example, faster detection for critical services. The new requirement is the ability to specify BFD intented configuration in the IPv4 and IPv6 static routes, including a required-min-rx-interval and multiplier.
* Management of VLAN 0 in tagged interfaces (Github issue #2): LxNM Yang models have a range defined for cvlan between 1 and 4094. VLAN 0 should also be supported and is used in deployments.
* Missing BGP intended configuration blocks (position against Attachment Circuits) (Github issue #3).
  * There are a set of BGP configuration blocks required to manage BGP based services which are present now in the AC-Model but not in the L3NM:
      * BGP Peer group creation
      * BGP Redistribution rules
  * Missing pointer to ACL (also present in Github issue #3).
      * ACL pointer to attach forwarding filter
* SRv6 support for L3VPN (issue #15): SRv6-based BGP services including L3VPN, whose procedures are defined in {{?RFC9252}}
* Improving Multicast Support:
   * For L3VPN with multicast, one implementation has reported that Cisco MVPN augmentation were added to include various profiles ( ipmsi and spmsi ) . There is YANG module from IETF as of today that supports full MVPN/SPMSI/IPMSI under L3NM directly. Standardized profiles are required to be added. 
### L2NM enhancements
* EVPN Remote and Local eth-tag (Github issue #6)
* Explicity asign a RD at node leve (Github issue #7)
     In the model, a RD must be always asigned via profile at service level. It is useful to be able to set a explicit RD directly at nodel level overriding the value of the profile. This way, a common profile can be used for the whole services for use cases where only RD changes per node.
* Add support for Flexible Cross-Connect (FXC) Service ({{?RFC9744}}) (Github issue #8)
* add explanatory text for EVPN multihoming using LAG (Github issue #9)
* support for vlan-lists/vlan-ranges (Github issue #10)
    When defining a Layer 2 service, sometimes multiple VLANs are mapped into a given service. It would be good to support this in the L2NM encapsulation stanza. Examples:
    * (i) typically used in single-tagged scenarios: vlan-id-list [ 200 210-219 222 234 240-249 ];
    * (ii) dual-tagged scenario, with s-vlan=430 and a list of c-vlans: vlan-tags outer 430 inner-list [ 200 210-219 222 234 240-249 ];
* SRv6 support for L2VPN (issue #15)
* Performance monitoring
   * ITU-T Y.1731 performance monitoring in Ethernet based networks . L2NM itself (RFCâ€¯9291) doesn't natively include OAM specifics
## New functionalities required to fully support connectivity services 
The realization of advance connectivity services requires, in addition to the configurations expressed in LxNM models:
* Definition of Access Control lists and prefix Sets:
   *Connectivity services often include mechanisms to filter forwarding packets. The LxNM models allow to include a 'forwarding-profile-identifier'. A forwarding profile refers to the policies that apply to the forwarding of packets conveyed within a VPN. Such policies may consist, for example, of applying Access Control Lists (ACLs). However, currently there is not an ACL network service model (even though a device level ACL model exists) that allows to manipulate such ACLs and sets when creating the service.
  * ACLs and Prefix sets can be reused among services. Thus, they need to be handled at a network level, regardless of the actual service using them. 
* Definition of routing policies, including community sets, as path sets, etc:
   * Advance connectivity services require the creation of complex policies. The LxNM models allows to indicate which policy (or policies) should be used. However, LxNM does not include the definition of policies. There are a set a device models which could be used as a base for the network model.
* Pre and post checks:
* Preparation of the interface. Prior to setting up .       
## Status of the intented Network Service. 
The Network Service Yang models represents an intent of the realization of service. A controller, after an instance of the network service yang intent has been created, will derive the necessary device level configurations and apply them to the necessary devices. However, the implementations reported a set of open issues which are related to the status. Those issues are not solved today and are left to implementation choices and solutions.

* Is the Service running on the Network? (Github issue #5)
  * How can the northbound system be assured with 100% certainty that a configuration has been successfully installed on the network device?
  * What mechanisms or feedback loops exist to confirm successful configuration deployment beyond simple acknowledgment?
  * How does the system can handle transient errors or partial configuration applications from the model perspective?
  * Are there specific operational attributes that can be used to reflect the real-time status of the configuration?
  * Does the network element provide any operational state parameters or notifications that indicate whether the configuration is active, pending, or has failed?
  * If a configuration is manually removed via CLI at the network device, is there a mechanism to reflect this change northbound?
* Operative Status Clarification (Github issue #4)
   Understanding the interrelationships between the operational status of VPN services, VPN nodes, and VPN network access is another significant operational gap. The status of a VPN service may depend on the status of the underlying VPN nodes and the network access provided to the VPN.
   To address this gap, IETF should establish clear dependencies and correlations between the various operational statuses. This could involve defining specific criteria for determining the overall status of a VPN service based on the status of its constituent VPN nodes and network access components. Moreover, real-time monitoring and correlation of status information can provide insights into the health and performance of VPN services.

## Summary
* L3NM and L2NM need to be updated to cover new technologies (such as SRv6), uncomplete support (such as multicast) and enhacemens
* New network yang models (such as ACLs and routing policies)
