1.  Introduction

   Service and Network YANG data models [RFC8199][RFC8309] such as the
   Layer 3 Network Model (L3NM) [RFC9182] and the Layer 2 Network Model
   (L2NM) [RFC9291] have been implemented to automate the deployment of
   VPN services by providers.  This document reports the findings from
   the implementations, deriving the functionalities required to update
   the Service and Network YANG data models.

   [RFC8969] documents the automation framework.  [RFC9315] documents
   Intent-based networking from IRTF perspective, with specific problems
   which are addressable today after the first deployments have been
   done.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Service and Network YANG Data Models in the IETF

   Several IETF Working Groups have developed YANG modules in order to
   foster the provisioning and, more generally, the deployment of
   services.  These modules focus on how the network operator intents to
   manage a network through protocols and devices to deliver a service.
   The intended configuration at the device level is derived from
   network YANG data models.  The customer service YANG data models
   abstract the service for upper layers.  The intended network service
   configuration is derived from the the service model.

   A set of these models is listed here:

   *  [RFC9182] As a complement to the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network
      Service Model (L3SM), which is used for communication between
      customers and service providers, L3NM is a Network Model (L3NM)
      that can be used for the provisioning of BGP based Layer 3 Virtual
      Private Network (L3VPN) services within a service provider
      network.

   *  [RFC9291] documents a data model that describes the deployment of
      various types of L2VPN, including VPWS and BGP based L2VPN, such
      as EVPNs.

4.  Observations and new requirements

4.1.  Enhancements to LxSM and LxNM

   Implementations of LxNM models in controllers required new
   functionalities which were not covered in [RFC9182] and [RFC9291] to
   deploy the missing functions in the Operator services.  This section
   compiles the functions that were reported by those implementations.

4.1.1.  L3NM Enhancements

   *  BFD parametrization of static routes (Github issue #1):

      -  The L3NM Yang data model allows to manage static routes in a
         VPN.  That is, for a particular VPN service, new Pv4 and IPv6
         static routes can be added, modified or deleted.  The data
         model allows to specify whether BFD is desired in the static
         route.  Whenever a controller derives the device configuration
         of the static route it will need to decide a particular BFD
         configuration, typically from a pre-defined template.
         Operators required, for different services, to customize the
         main BFD parameters to allow, for example, faster detection for
         critical services.  The new requirement is the ability to
         specify BFD intended configuration in the IPv4 and IPv6 static
         routes, including a required-min-rx-interval and multiplier.

   *  Management of VLAN 0 in tagged interfaces (Github issue #2): LxNM
      Yang models have a range defined for cvlan between 1 and 4094.
      VLAN 0 should also be supported and is used in deployments.

   *  Missing BGP intended configuration blocks (in relation to
      Attachment Circuits) (Github issue #3).

      -  There are a set of BGP configuration blocks required to manage
         BGP based services which are present now in the AC-Model but
         not in the L3NM:

         o  BGP Peer group creation

         o  BGP Redistribution rules

      -  Missing pointer to ACL (also present in Github issue #3).

         o  ACL pointer to attach forwarding filter

   *  SRv6 support for L3VPN (Github issue #15): SRv6-based BGP services
      including L3VPN, whose procedures are defined in [RFC9252]

   *  Improving Multicast Support:

      -  For L3VPN with multicast, one implementation has reported that
         Cisco MVPN augmentation were added to include various profiles
         ( ipmsi and spmsi ) . There is no YANG module from IETF as of
         today that supports full MVPN/SPMSI/IPMSI under L3NM directly.
         Standardized profiles are required to be added.

   *  Extend guidance of how the network models can be used to/and
      operationalize Inter-AS VPN options (A, B, and C as defined in
      [RFC4364]) using the L3NM framework (Github issue #25).

4.1.2.  L2NM Enhancements

   *  EVPN Remote and Local eth-tag (Github issue #6)

   *  Explicitly assign a RD at node level (Github issue #7)

      -  In the model, a RD must be always assigned via profile at
         service level.  It is useful to be able to set a explicit RD
         directly at node level overriding the value of the profile.
         This way, a common profile can be used for all the services for
         use cases where only RD changes per node.

   *  Add support for Flexible Cross-Connect (FXC) Service ([RFC9744])
      (Github issue #8)

   *  Add explanatory text for EVPN multihoming using LAG (Github issue
      #9)

   *  support for vlan-lists/vlan-ranges (Github issue #10)

      -  When defining a Layer 2 service, sometimes multiple VLANs are
         mapped into a given service.  It would be good to support this
         in the L2NM encapsulation stanza.  Examples are as follows:

         o  Typically used in single-tagged scenarios: vlan-id-list [
            200 210-219 222 234 240-249 ];

         o  Dual-tagged scenario, with s-vlan=430 and a list of c-vlans:
            vlan-tags outer 430 inner-list [ 200 210-219 222 234 240-249
            ];

   *  SRv6 support for L2VPN (Github issue #15)

   *  Performance monitoring

      -  ITU-T Y.1731 performance monitoring in Ethernet based networks
         . L2NM itself [RFC9291] doesn't natively include OAM specifics.

   *  Add EVI identifier to differentiate it from VPN-ID.  Each EVI maps
      to a specific EVPN service (e.g., a Layer 2 VPN bridging a
      particular VLAN across the EVPN fabric) (Github issue #24).

4.2.  New Functionalities Required to Fully Support Connectivity
      Services

   The realization of advanced connectivity services requires, in
   addition to the configurations expressed in LxNM models: * Definition
   of Access Control lists and prefix Sets: + Connectivity services
   often include mechanisms to filter forwarding packets.  The LxNM
   models allow to include a 'forwarding-profile-identifier'.  A
   forwarding profile refers to the policies that apply to the
   forwarding of packets conveyed within a VPN.  Such policies may
   consist, for example, of applying Access Control Lists (ACLs).
   However, currently there is not an ACL network service model (even
   though a device level ACL model exists) that allows to manipulate
   such ACLs and sets when creating the service.  + ACLs and Prefix sets
   can be reused among services.  Thus, they need to be handled at a
   network level, regardless of the actual service using them. *
   Definition of routing policies, including community sets, as path
   sets, etc: + Advanced connectivity services require the creation of
   complex policies.  The LxNM models allows to indicate which policy
   (or policies) should be used.  However, LxNM does not include the
   definition of policies.  There are a set a device models which could
   be used as a base for the network model. * Pre and post checks before
   and after deploying a service in the network. * Preparation of the
   interface.  Prior to the application of the entire configuration
   profile.

4.3.  Status of the Intended Network Service

   The Network Service Yang models represent an intent of the
   realization of service.  A controller, after an instance of the
   network service yang intent has been created, will derive the
   necessary device level configurations and apply them to the necessary
   devices.  However, the implementations reported a set of open issues
   which are related to the status.  Those issues are not solved today
   and are left to implementation choices and solutions.

   *  Is the Service running on the Network?  (Github issue #5)

      -  How can the northbound system be assured with 100% certainty
         that a configuration has been successfully installed on the
         network device?

      -  What mechanisms or feedback loops exist to confirm successful
         configuration deployment beyond simple acknowledgment?

      -  How can the system can handle transient errors or partial
         configuration applications from the model perspective?

      -  Are there specific operational attributes that can be used to
         reflect the real-time status of the configuration?

      -  Does the network element provide any operational state
         parameters or notifications that indicate whether the
         configuration is active, pending, or has failed?

      -  If a configuration is manually removed via CLI at the network
         device, is there a mechanism to reflect this change northbound?

   *  Operational Status Clarification (Github issue #4)

      -  Understanding the interrelationships between the operational
         status of VPN services, VPN nodes, and VPN network access is
         another significant operational gap.  The status of a VPN
         service may depend on the status of the underlying VPN nodes
         and the network access provided to the VPN.

      -  To address this gap, IETF should establish clear dependencies
         and correlations between the various operational statuses.
         This could involve defining specific criteria for determining
         the overall status of a VPN service based on the status of its
         constituent VPN nodes and network access components.  Moreover,
         real-time monitoring and correlation of status information can
         provide insights into the health and performance of VPN
         services.

4.4.  Summary

   *  L3NM and L2NM need to be updated to cover new technologies (such
      as SRv6), incomplete support (such as multicast) and enhancements.

   *  New network YANG data models (such as ACLs and routing policies)
