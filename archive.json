The status of a VPN service may depend on the status of the underlying VPN nodes and the network access provided to the VPN.\n\nTo address this gap, IETF should establish clear dependencies and correlations between the various operational statuses. This could involve defining specific criteria for determining the overall status of a VPN service based on the status of its constituent VPN nodes and network access components. Moreover, real-time monitoring and correlation of status information can provide insights into the health and performance of VPN services.",

      "body": "\nDear L3NM Working Group Members,\n\nI am writing to propose a modification to the peer-as leaf definition within our YANG models. Currently, the peer-as leaf is defined as:\n\nleaf peer-as {\ntype inet:as-number;\nmandatory true;\ndescription\n\"Indicates the customer's ASN when\nthe customer requests BGP routing.\";\n}\n\nWhile type inet:as-number is the standard and semantically correct choice for Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), I propose introducing a union type for peer-as to allow for greater flexibility, specifically by including a string type alongside inet:as-number. This would accommodate certain operational or legacy requirements where ASNs might be represented in non-standard string formats.\n\nThe proposed modification would look like this:\n\nleaf peer-as {\nmandatory true;\ndescription\n\"Indicates the customer's ASN when\nthe customer requests BGP routing.\";\ntype union {\ntype inet:as-number; // Retain the standard ASN type\ntype string {\n// Define a pattern that allows for specific string representations,\n// e.g., asdot+ or other custom formats.\n// Example pattern (this would need to be carefully refined):\npattern '[0-9]+.[0-9]+';\ndescription \"Allows for ASNs represented as strings, e.g., asdot+ format or other specific string notations.\";\n}\n}\n}\n\nThe rationale for this proposal is to provide a mechanism for:\n\nEnhanced Flexibility: To support scenarios where ASNs are provided or consumed in specific string formats that might not be strictly conformant with inet:as-number's internal parsing or for custom/legacy system integrations.\nExplicit String Representation: Even though inet:as-number handles both \"asplain\" (integer) and \"asdot+\" (e.g., 65000.100) notations, explicitly allowing a string type in the union can provide a clear distinction for systems that prefer to represent \"asdot+\" as a string or require other specific string patterns.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge the implications of including a string type. A broadly defined pattern, such as [0-9]+.[0-9]+, could inadvertently accept values that are syntactically valid strings but semantically invalid ASNs. For instance, a value like 64086.59905 would be accepted by this pattern, despite not being a valid ASN in standard \"asplain\" or \"asdot+\" formats. Therefore, if a string type is included, its pattern must be meticulously crafted to strictly validate against intended string representations (e.g., a precise regex for \"asdot+\" or other agreed-upon formats) to prevent the configuration of semantically incorrect data.\n\nThis approach aims to strike a balance between strict type enforcement and practical operational flexibility.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n",
